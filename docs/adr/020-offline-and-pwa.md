# ADR-020: Offline and PWA

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-03
- **Source of truth:** [Architecture & ADRs](https://linear.app/materia-web/document/architecture-and-adrs-b15e1eb322dc) (mirrored in [`docs/01-architecture-and-adrs.md`](../01-architecture-and-adrs.md))

## Decision

- Firestore `persistentLocalCache` with a multi-tab manager, plus the Angular service worker for the shell.
- Offline writes are allowed only for client-direct write paths. Callables show "needs connection".

## Changing this decision

Write a superseding ADR in `docs/adr/` (copy [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md)), link it from the Linear doc, and get it approved in review. Do not change this decision inside a feature PR.
